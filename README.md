# Maji_Ndogo_project_progress_visualization

## Project Overview
These Power BI dashboards tracks the progress of a multi-year project to improve clean water access in the fictitious country of Maji Ndogo. The analysis visualizes data collected at three stages: stage 1 (Jan 2023), a mid-term review (Mar 2024), and the projected end stage review (July 2027).

## Key Questions and Insights
1. **Project Progress** - What is the completion rate? How many water sources are pending completion?
2. **Regional Analysis** - What are the costs incurred so far per province?
3. **Impact Measurement** - What is the % population with access to basic water? How many people have been helped?
